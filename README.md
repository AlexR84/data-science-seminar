During active semesters we hold weekly meetings, whree a chapter of a book is presented by a developing instructor with a focus on modern applied statistical methodology and using the R language. Our meetings are open to all (see details below) and our materials are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License. We hope you find these materials useful and will join our sessions.
