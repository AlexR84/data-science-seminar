## Statistical Learning Book Club

The Statistical Learning Book Club is led by epidemiology DPH student Jesica 
Rodriguez-Lopez and epidemiology MPH student Lucas Schiffer. This group meets 
once a week on Fridays from 10 to 11 AM EST and members take turns presenting 
sections of the textbook Data Analysis for the Life Sciences. All are welcome to 
join and only a curiousity for statistics is required.
