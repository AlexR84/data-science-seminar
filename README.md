## Current activities

During Oct 2018 - Jan 2019 we will be reading and doing exercises from
[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in
R](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by Gareth James, Daniela
Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. See the [schedule
wiki](https://github.com/waldronlab/data-science-seminar/wiki).

## About us

This repository represent the joint effort of [Paris Lodron University
of Salzburg](https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=52) and the
[City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and
Health Policy](http://sph.cuny.edu/). During active semesters we hold
weekly meetings, whree a chapter of a book is presented by a
developing instructor with a focus on modern applied statistical
methodology and using the R language. Our meetings are open to all
(see details below) and our materials are licensed under the Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License. We
hope you find these materials useful and will join our sessions.

## Getting started

1. If you don't already have them, install R and RStudio following
these
[instructions](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jutts/110/InstallingRandRStudio.pdf). Here
is a short video showing [how to use RStudio to contribute to this
Github repo](http://youtu.be/uHYcDQDbMY8).

2. Sign up for a GitHub account (also free) and clone this repository
(open membership) in RStudio. Don't know what that means? Follow this
[tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). The process
in RStudio is documented
[here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)
or there is a video
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-managing-part-2/).

3. Join our Google Group (open membership) and sign up to receive
emails by visiting
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stat_learning.

## Schedule

View the presentation schedule, and reserve a presentation spot for
yourself, on the [presentation schedule
wiki](https://github.com/waldronlab/data-science-seminar/wiki).

## Presenting

1. Pick the date or topic that best suits you.

2. Edit this file, adding you GitHub username to the schedule table.

3. Read the chapter in the book.

4. Edit the presentation file using RStudio. All presentations should
be authored using the `.Rpres` format, more infomation about the
format is available
[here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468). Additionally,
some previous presentation that can be used as examples are available
[here](https://github.com/waldronlab/Book_Club/tree/master/Data%20Analysis%20for%20the%20Life%20Sciences).

5. Commit the presentation to GitHub from RStudio so that it is
available to others. Don't know what that means? The process is
documented
[here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)
or there is a video
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-managing-part-2/).
